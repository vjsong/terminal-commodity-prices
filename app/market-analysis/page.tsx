   - Infrastructure spending in major economies supporting steel demand
   - Technology sector growth maintaining pressure on rare earth elements

3. PRICE VOLATILITY
   - Central bank policies affecting investment flows
   - Dollar strength impacting commodity prices
   - Speculative positioning creating short-term price swings

REGIONAL INSIGHTS:

OUTLOOK:
--------
The metals market is expected to remain volatile through the coming quarters, with divergent performance across different metals. Critical battery metals ([[lithium|/lithium-market]], nickel, cobalt) are projected to maintain structural support despite near-term corrections, while traditional industrial metals face more challenging demand environments.

Strategic positioning should focus on metals with strong long-term demand fundamentals tied to energy transition and technological advancement, while maintaining tactical flexibility to navigate short-term volatility.
